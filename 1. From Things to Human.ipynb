    "Before anything appeared on the earth, there was a time that even earth itself had not been existed. There are only stars--huge burning balls of fire.One of these stars is our sun, whirling and sputtering and throwing off sparks. One of these sparks, which the sun threw far off, got cool and became the world, or earth, that we now live in.\n",

    "At first, our earth was nothing but a ball of rock, wrapped around with steam. Then the steam turned to rain, which filled up hollows and made enormously big puddles--oceans.\n",
    "Then came the first living things--tiny plants. Plants grew in many places, from the water, along the water's edge, to on the rock.\n",
    "So as the animals, insects. The animals, who can only live in the water is Fish, who can live both in the water and land is Amphibians, those amphibians that can walk are Reptiles.\n",
    "Then came the Birds, Mammals and People."

    "There are two kinds of guess, lucky guess and common sense. We could deduce something in the past because we ascertain something must happen in a particular way, or a definite way. For exmaple, We have found the heads of arrows and sprears and hatchets, so we are sure that only human beings could have made and used such things because birds and fish or any other animals do not use hatchets or spears. So, we are also sure that these people must live long years ago before iron and stell were known.\n",

    "\n",
    "We think people next discovered tin and mixed tin with coppoer to make a still harder metal than either alone. This metal, made of tin and copper together, we now call bronze. For two or three thousand years people made their tools and weapon out of bronze, we call that time **the Bronze Age**"
